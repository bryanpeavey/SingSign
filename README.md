## Chrome Extension

To run the Chrome Extension,

1. Create a config.json file in the same directory as popup.js, in this file you will store your api key. You will store your api key in this file as:
   {
   "apiKey": "your_key_here"
   }
1. Keep in mind that this API key has a quota of about 100 words, so you can only run about 3-5 songs before you hit that quota.
1. Navigate to chrome://extensions on your chrome browser. Ensure developer mode is turned on (top right of the page). Then click load unpacked and upload the directory to have the extension uploaded to your browser.
